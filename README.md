## Biggest Issue

The biggest issue I faced in making this project was styling my css so that the elements do not overlap on the add entry page when changning window size. I proided a temporary fix by positioning the elements relatively, but I believe a better fix would be to use media queries.

## What I Learned

This project solidified my understanding of building a fullstack application from scratch. It reminded me how to set up a back end using postgreSQL as the database, and express and sequelize to communicate with the database and hit the correct api routes. I also improved my css styling abilities with this project and refined my abilities with React.

## What I would do differently

I would have spent a little less time with CSS, and instead focused more of my energy on getting all of the functionality I wanted down.
